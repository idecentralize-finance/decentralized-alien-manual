### Introduction

We took a concept you like and added a layer of fun. Your alien can give you access to various bonuses when when trading.

Floating around in the universe is fun but having a fast alien spaceship is even more fun and will help you reach your goal faster. The ship will give your alien positions some advantage like discount on fees, air drops and who know what else. Take a look at the spaceship section to learn more.

Liquidity Providers can collect Planets from the pool that uses one single NFT as proof of ownership in the pool. Your aliens ships bonuses apply.
