Congratulations! At this point Metamask is already connected to the Ethereum Mainnet by default. We will show you how to add the Polygon Network and the Binance Smart Chain to your Metamask wallet in the next section.

IMPORTANT - Your 12 word seed phase is the only thing that allows you to secure your wallet. You should keep it safe and in a place that is hidden. If you ever need to do a PC reset or you want to move your wallet to another machine, you will need you 12 word seed phrase to do this.
