## Gnosis Safe Vault Setup

The Gnosis Safe Vault is an extra layer of security. It allows you to fully customize how you manage your company crypto assets, with the option to require a predefined number of signatures to confirm transactions. Require multiple team members to confirm every transaction in order to execute it, which helps prevent unauthorized access to company crypto.

## Connect your Metamask wallet to Gnosis-Safe

Connecting your Metamask wallet to Gnosis is the first step in securing your Safe. You will need to use the account for which the project or team will use.
