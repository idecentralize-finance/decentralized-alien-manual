The spice is what make space travel possible. It's an ERC20 that will affect performance of your ship. Your spice gauge will indicate the performance. To enter any Planetary Pool with a bonus from your ship it must have some spice. A small amount of spice is burned when you lift-off a planet or when you exit your ship
