#  SPICES

![We have a lift off!](../.gitbook/assets/AdobeStock\_242315944.jpeg)

The Spice is what makes space travel possible. It's an ERC20 that will affect the performance of your ship. Your Spice gauge will indicate the performance. To enter any Planetary Pool with a bonus from your ship, it must have some Spice. A small amount of Spice is burned when you lift-off of a planet or when you exit your ship.
