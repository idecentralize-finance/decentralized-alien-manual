Spaceships are also a unique ERC721 token. Not only will they make your Alien stand out, they will also offer various bonuses. To get access to these bonuses you will need to fill your ship with Spice. The level of Spice in your reactor determines the bonuses you get. Some ships might perform better than others in some areas.

Ship bonus examples, feel free to edit.

* Discount on fees.
* Bonus on yield.
* Airdrops

Spice is highly explosive!
